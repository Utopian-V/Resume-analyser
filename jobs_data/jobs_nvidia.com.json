      "description": "Into the Omniverse: OpenUSD Workflows Advance Physical AI for Robotics, Autonomous VehiclesNVIDIA Cosmos accelerates physical AI development with world foundation models that predict future world states as videos.January 22, 2025byPranjali JoshiShareEmail0Editor\u2019s note: This post is part ofInto the Omniverse, a series focused on how developers, 3D practitioners and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advances in Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) andNVIDIA Omniverse.The next frontier of AI isphysical AI.Physical AI models can understand instructions and perceive, interact and perform complex actions in the real world to power autonomous machines like robots and self-driving cars.Similar to howlarge language modelscan process and generate text, physical AI models can understand the world and generate actions. To do this, these models must be trained in simulation environments to comprehend physical dynamics, like gravity, friction or inertia \u2014 and understand geometric and spatial relationships, as well as the principles of cause and effect.Global leaders in software development and professional services are usingNVIDIA Omniverse, powered byOpenUSD, to build new products and services that will accelerate the development of AI and controllable simulations to enable the creation of true-to-reality virtual worlds, known asdigital twins, that can be used to train physical AI with unprecedented accuracy and detail.Generate Exponentially More Synthetic Data With Omniverse and NVIDIA CosmosAtCES, NVIDIA announcedgenerative AI models and blueprintsthat expand Omniverse integration further into physical AI applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles and vision AI.Among these announcements wasNVIDIA Cosmos, a platform of state-of-the-art generative world foundation models, advanced tokenizers, guardrails and an accelerated video processing pipeline \u2014 all designed to accelerate physical AI development.Developing physical AI models is a costly, resource- and time-intensive process that requires vast amounts of real-world data and testing. Cosmos\u2019world foundation models(WFM),\u00a0 which predict future world states as videos based on multimodal inputs,\u00a0 provide an easy way for developers to generate massive amounts of photoreal, physics-basedsynthetic datato train and evaluate AI for robotics, autonomous vehicles and machines. Developers can also fine-tune Cosmos WFMs to build downstream world models or improve quality and efficiency for specific physical AI use cases.When paired with Omniverse, Cosmos creates a powerful synthetic data multiplication engine. Developers can use Omniverse to create 3D scenarios, then feed the outputs into Cosmos to generate controlled videos and variations. This can drastically accelerate the development of physical AI systems such as autonomous vehicles and robots by rapidly generating exponentially more training data covering a variety of environments and interactions.OpenUSD ensures the data in these scenarios is seamlessly integrated and consistently represented, enhancing the realism and effectiveness of the simulations.Leading robotics and automotive companies, including1X,Agile Robots,Agility Robotics,Figure AI,Foretellix,Fourier,Galbot,Hillbot,IntBot,Neura Robotics,Skild AI,Virtual Incision,WaabiandXPENG, along with ridesharing giantUber, are among the first to adopt Cosmos.Learn more about how world foundation models will advance physical AI by listening to theNVIDIA AI Podcast episodewith Ming-Yu Liu, vice president of research at NVIDIA.See Cosmos in Action for Physical AI Use CasesCosmos WFMs are revolutionizing industries by providing a unified framework for developing, training and deploying large-scale AI models across various applications. Enterprises in the automotive, industrial and robotics sectors can harness the power of generative physical AI and simulation to accelerate innovation and operational efficiency.Humanoid robots: TheNVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprintfor synthetic motion generation helps developers generate massive synthetic motion datasets to trainhumanoid robotsusing imitation learning. WithGR00T workflows, users can capture human actions and use Cosmos to exponentially increase the size and variety of the dataset, making it more robust for training physical AI systems.Autonomous vehicles:Autonomous vehicle (AV) simulationpowered byOmniverse Sensor RTX application programming interfaceslets AV developers replay driving data, generate new ground-truth data and perform closed-loop testing to accelerate their pipelines. With Cosmos, developers can generate synthetic driving scenarios to amplify training data by orders of magnitude, accelerating physical AI model development for autonomous vehicles. Global ridesharing giantUberis partnering with NVIDIA to accelerate autonomous mobility. Rich driving datasets from Uber, combined with Cosmos andNVIDIA DGX Cloud, can help AV partners build stronger AI models more efficiently.Industrial settings:Mega is an Omniverse Blueprintfor developing, testing and optimizing physical AI and robot fleets at scale in a USD-based digital twin before deployment in factories and warehouses. The blueprint uses Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX APIs to simultaneously render multisensor data from any type of intelligent machine, enabling high-fidelitysensor simulationat scale. Cosmos can enhance Mega by generating synthetic edge case scenarios to amplify training data, significantly improving the robustness and efficiency of training robots in simulation. KION Group, a supply chain solutions company, is among the first toadopt Mega to drive warehouse automationin retail, consumer packaged goods, parcel services and more.Get Plugged Into the World of OpenUSDFor more on Cosmos, watch the replay ofNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s CES keynote, andget startedwith Cosmos WFMs available now underan open model licenseonHugging Faceand theNVIDIA NGC catalog.

To do this, these models must be trained in simulation environments to comprehend physical dynamics, like gravity, friction or inertia \u2014 and understand geometric and spatial relationships, as well as the principles of cause and effect.Global leaders in software development and professional services are usingNVIDIA Omniverse, powered byOpenUSD, to build new products and services that will accelerate the development of AI and controllable simulations to enable the creation of true-to-reality virtual worlds, known asdigital twins, that can be used to train physical AI with unprecedented accuracy and detail.Generate Exponentially More Synthetic Data With Omniverse and NVIDIA CosmosAtCES, NVIDIA announcedgenerative AI models and blueprintsthat expand Omniverse integration further into physical AI applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles and vision AI.Among these announcements wasNVIDIA Cosmos, a platform of state-of-the-art generative world foundation models, advanced tokenizers, guardrails and an accelerated video processing pipeline \u2014 all designed to accelerate physical AI development.Developing physical AI models is a costly, resource- and time-intensive process that requires vast amounts of real-world data and testing. Cosmos\u2019world foundation models(WFM),\u00a0 which predict future world states as videos based on multimodal inputs,\u00a0 provide an easy way for developers to generate massive amounts of photoreal, physics-basedsynthetic datato train and evaluate AI for robotics, autonomous vehicles and machines. Developers can also fine-tune Cosmos WFMs to build downstream world models or improve quality and efficiency for specific physical AI use cases.When paired with Omniverse, Cosmos creates a powerful synthetic data multiplication engine. Developers can use Omniverse to create 3D scenarios, then feed the outputs into Cosmos to generate controlled videos and variations. This can drastically accelerate the development of physical AI systems such as autonomous vehicles and robots by rapidly generating exponentially more training data covering a variety of environments and interactions.OpenUSD ensures the data in these scenarios is seamlessly integrated and consistently represented, enhancing the realism and effectiveness of the simulations.Leading robotics and automotive companies, including1X,Agile Robots,Agility Robotics,Figure AI,Foretellix,Fourier,Galbot,Hillbot,IntBot,Neura Robotics,Skild AI,Virtual Incision,WaabiandXPENG, along with ridesharing giantUber, are among the first to adopt Cosmos.Learn more about how world foundation models will advance physical AI by listening to theNVIDIA AI Podcast episodewith Ming-Yu Liu, vice president of research at NVIDIA.See Cosmos in Action for Physical AI Use CasesCosmos WFMs are revolutionizing industries by providing a unified framework for developing, training and deploying large-scale AI models across various applications. Enterprises in the automotive, industrial and robotics sectors can harness the power of generative physical AI and simulation to accelerate innovation and operational efficiency.Humanoid robots: TheNVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprintfor synthetic motion generation helps developers generate massive synthetic motion datasets to trainhumanoid robotsusing imitation learning. WithGR00T workflows, users can capture human actions and use Cosmos to exponentially increase the size and variety of the dataset, making it more robust for training physical AI systems.Autonomous vehicles:Autonomous vehicle (AV) simulationpowered byOmniverse Sensor RTX application programming interfaceslets AV developers replay driving data, generate new ground-truth data and perform closed-loop testing to accelerate their pipelines. With Cosmos, developers can generate synthetic driving scenarios to amplify training data by orders of magnitude, accelerating physical AI model development for autonomous vehicles. Global ridesharing giantUberis partnering with NVIDIA to accelerate autonomous mobility. Rich driving datasets from Uber, combined with Cosmos andNVIDIA DGX Cloud, can help AV partners build stronger AI models more efficiently.Industrial settings:Mega is an Omniverse Blueprintfor developing, testing and optimizing physical AI and robot fleets at scale in a USD-based digital twin before deployment in factories and warehouses. The blueprint uses Omniverse Cloud Sensor RTX APIs to simultaneously render multisensor data from any type of intelligent machine, enabling high-fidelitysensor simulationat scale. Cosmos can enhance Mega by generating synthetic edge case scenarios to amplify training data, significantly improving the robustness and efficiency of training robots in simulation.
