"""
Main FastAPI Application Entry Point
Handled by: DevOps Team
Purpose: Application startup, routing, middleware configuration, and lifecycle management

This module serves as the main entry point for the PrepNexus backend API.
It configures the FastAPI application, sets up middleware, includes all
feature routers, and manages the application lifecycle including database
connections.

Key responsibilities:
- FastAPI application configuration and startup
- CORS middleware setup for frontend communication
- Database connection lifecycle management
- Feature router inclusion and organization
- Health check and monitoring endpoints
- SEO module integration (sitemap, RSS)
